# World of Warcraft table system 

Working prototype! 

Was developed for raid requests and search for teammates! 

Have 3 pages:

+ Create raid 
+ Create request for raid going 
+ Watch all players for cuurent requests!

My first teamwork where i was like Lead of devs, make connection, task create, etc.

# Technologies 

+ NestJs for backend, easylly create 3 tables for every raid
+ Webpack for some packages and dev server! 
+ Clean JS, because i just want it, and team do not have some expiries with react!
